# EDA-Renewable-energy
- Exploratory data analysis on the impacts of different Weather conditions on Renewable Energy Generation

# About Dataset:
The dataset called "Solar_weather.csv" is a freely available collection of data on Kaggle that was gathered using the OpenWeatherMap API. The data was compiled by AI Maverick and provides a detailed analysis of the intricate correlation between weather conditions and the production of renewable energy. It contains hourly measurements of various weather parameters including solar radiation, temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Researchers and analysts can utilize this dataset to examine how weather patterns affect energy consumption and production.

# Conclusion
**1.More than 70% of energy consumption is lie between 0-1000 Wh.<br>
2.The Energy delta [Wh] and GHI is directly proportional to each other.<br>
3.Temperature is one of the key factors when compared with energy consumption/generation.<br>
4.Monthly consumption/generation of energy is more in months of April, May, June followed by March, July, August, September and least in October, November, December, & January.<br>
5.When we compare the monthly average temp with monthly average consumption despite of low temperature in Feb, Mar & Apr we noticed high consumption.**
